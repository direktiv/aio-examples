description: |
  Passively listen for cloud events where the type equals "greetingcloudevent" and
  then execute a action state to call the direktiv/greeting action, which 'greets' 
  the user specified in the "name" field of the input provided to the flow.

  Because this flow has a start of type event, directly executing this flow 
  is not necessary.

#
# Start of type event definition sets the flow to be executed when a event
# is triggered with the defined type 'greetingcloudevent'
#
start:
  type: event
  state: greeter
  event:
    type: greetingcloudevent

functions:
- id: hello-world
  image: direktiv/hello-world:dev
  type: knative-workflow

  
states:
- id: greeter
  type: action
  log: jq(.greetingcloudevent.data.name)
  action: 
    function: hello-world
    input: 
      name: jq(.greetingcloudevent.data.name)
  transform: 'jq({ "greeting": .return."hello-world" })'
