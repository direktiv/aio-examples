# Simple Route  

Routing is part of Direktiv's gateway. If an endoint file is detected Direktiv creates the route and serves it to clients. The following example routes a GET request to a flow. 

Depending on the name of the namespace the URL would be something like `https://YOURSERVER/ns/examples/hello`.


[Route](route1.yaml)


[Flow](wf1.yaml)
